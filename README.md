## Introduction

Fast food chains play a significant role in the modern food industry and have witnessed substantial expansion over the years. This project aims to analyze their expansion strategies, health implications, and geographic distribution using data visualization tools. Key components of the project include:

- **Data Collection**: The project begins by collecting a diverse dataset that includes historical expansion data, health issues caused, obesity trends, and more, pertaining to fast food chain locations.

- **Data Processing**: The collected data is then integrated and processed to identify key expansion trends and patterns.

- **Tableau Visualization**: Utilizing the Tableau application, the project creates interactive maps that visually represent the geographic spread of fast food chains over time.


- **Gephi**: Gephi is an open-source software for visualizing and exploring networks and complex systems.

- **Tableau**: Tableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that enables interactive and shareable dashboards.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots and charts.

- **Pandas**: Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It is used here for data preprocessing.

This project provides a template and examples for using these tools together to create stunning visualizations for your datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Gephi: Download and install Gephi from the [official website](https://gephi.org/).

- Tableau: Install Tableau Desktop or use Tableau Public, available at [tableau.com](https://www.tableau.com/).

- Matplotlib and Pandas: Install the required Python libraries using pip

- NumPy: Install NumPy using pip

  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib pandas numpy

## Usage 
To use this project for your data visualization needs, follow these general steps:

Prepare Your Data: Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel). You may need to use Pandas for data preprocessing if required.

Gephi: Use Gephi to create network visualizations or explore complex relationships in your data. Import your data into Gephi and customize the visualization as needed.

Tableau: Create interactive and shareable dashboards using Tableau. Connect your data source and design your dashboard with charts and filters.

Matplotlib: If you need to create custom plots or charts that are not easily achieved with Gephi or Tableau, use Matplotlib to generate them in Python.

Document Your Work: Ensure your code and visualizations are well-documented for reference. Include explanations, comments, and any relevant context.

Share Your Insights: Share your visualizations and findings with others. You can export Gephi projects, Tableau dashboards, or Matplotlib plots and share them as needed.
